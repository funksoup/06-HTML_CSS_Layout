  <p>Josephine Dorado is a social entrepreneur, media studies professor and creative technologist whose work focuses on the convergence of physical and digital experiences, arts with technology, and games with calls to action. Her work has garnered multiple Fulbright awards and a MacArthur Foundation award in Digital Media & Learning. As part of a Fulbright-Museumsquartier artist residency, Josephine worked with refugees in Austria to create virtual reality media narratives of their journeys. She currently teaches at The New School, specializing in immersive learning and media/tech for conflict zones, and leads digital marketing for a b2b financial services firm that funds community development programs. In addition, Josephine is a trainer for the State Department’s TechCamps, an initiative to aid civil society organizations in developing countries by building their digital capacities, and has taught workshops in mobile storytelling and games in countries such as Ukraine, Palestine and Tunisia. Previously, Josephine founded Kidz Connect, a virtual cultural exchange program that connects youth internationally through creative collaboration and performance in virtual worlds. She continues to be involved in the Fulbright community as President Emeritus of Fulbright’s NY Chapter and as a Director on the National Board. Her speaking engagements include Talks @ Google, TEDxFulbright, SXSW, IgniteNYC and SIGGRAPH.
